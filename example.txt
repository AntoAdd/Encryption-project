Vinod Vaikuntanathan, the Ford Foundation Professor of Engineering at MIT, explains the potential impact: "If large-scale quantum computers ever get built, then factoring is toast and we have to find something else to use for cryptography.
But how real is this threat?
Can we make quantum factoring practical?
Our work could potentially bring us one step closer to a practical implementation."

Despite significant progress in quantum computing over the past three decades, we're still far from building a quantum computer powerful enough to run Shor's algorithm effectively.
Current estimates suggest that about 20 million qubits (quantum bits) would be needed, while the largest quantum computers today have only around 1,100 qubits.
